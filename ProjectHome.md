The aim of this project is to provide simple Linux tools that are not currently available. Below is a list of highlighted tools:

- **runcmd**: runcmd allows you to run other commands with many useful options. Options include: setting a timeout value, setting the cpu affinity, and defining a file where the spawned command's exit status and resource usage can be recorded.

- **grep-recursive**: grep-recursive combines find and grep to perform a recursive grep.

- **replace**: For those that don't know sed/awk, replace performs global replacements in files.

- **getctypeinfo**: A program that prints out the number of bits in and the min and max values of many common C types.

- **libsiltgraph.a**: A c++ library for generating simple graphs, using gnuplot. Currently, the only type of graph that is supported is a line graph.
